- Firebase security rules that restrict data access to authorized users only
- Regular security audits of our backend infrastructure

Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## In-App Purchases

The Application offers the following in-app purchases:

### Consumable Purchases

These items can be purchased multiple times:

- **Stat Respec** ($0.99) – Allows the player to reallocate all character stat points

### Non-Consumable Purchases

### Payment Processing and Security

All payment processing is handled securely through the Apple App Store. We do not directly collect or store your credit card information.

Purchase receipts are validated with Apple's servers to ensure transaction authenticity. We maintain a record of completed transactions (transaction ID, product purchased, date) to prevent fraud and provide customer support, but this record does not include your payment information.

Please refer to Apple's Privacy Policy for information on how they handle payment information.

## Game Center Integration

The Application integrates with Apple's Game Center for features such as:

- Achievement tracking (battle victories, level milestones, loot collection)
- Leaderboards (player level, power score, PvP rating)

When you connect to Game Center, your Game Center information is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy. We only receive your Game Center player ID and public information you choose to share (such as your Game Center nickname). We do not have access to your personal Apple ID or contact information.

You can disconnect Game Center at any time through your iOS device settings without affecting your ability to play Echoes of the Goetia.

## Multiplayer Interactions

Echoes of the Goetia features PvP (player versus player) combat where your actions are visible to other players, including:

- Your display name (visible to opponents)
- Your character level and power score (visible during matchmaking and battle)
- Your combat actions and battle results (visible to your opponent)

Your display name is the only personally-identifiable information visible to other players. Other players cannot see your email address or any other personal data. The Application does not include direct messaging or chat features between players.

## Server-Authoritative Architecture

For security and fair play, Echoes of the Goetia uses a server-authoritative architecture. This means:

- All game actions are validated by our backend servers
- Your device has read-only access to game data
- All changes to game state (stat allocations, equipment changes, battle actions, loot generation) are processed through our secure Cloud Run API
- This prevents cheating and ensures fair gameplay for all users

While this architecture requires an internet connection to play, it ensures the integrity of the multiplayer experience. Limited offline access to cached character and inventory data is available for viewing purposes only.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the updated policy on this page.

You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. The "Effective Date" at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.
