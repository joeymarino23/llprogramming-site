<h2>Automatic Data Collection and Analytics</h2>
<p>We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage, which features are most popular, and how players progress through the game. This helps us improve the Application and provide a better gaming experience.</p>

</ul>
<p>To protect your privacy, we use encryption and anonymization techniques to ensure that third parties cannot identify you personally based on this data.</p>

<h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>

<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

<p>Even after account deletion, we may retain anonymized, aggregated data that cannot be used to identify you personally. This data is used for analytics and improving the game experience.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
<p>The Application is rated for ages 12+ due to mild fantasy violence. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under 13 has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:LLProgramming@yahoo.com">LLProgramming@yahoo.com</a>. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain.</p>
<p>Security measures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encryption of authentication credentials and sensitive data</li>
  <li>Secure HTTPS communication between the Application and our servers</li>
  <li>Server-side validation of all game actions to prevent cheating</li>
  <li>Firebase security rules that restrict data access to authorized users only</li>
  <li>Regular security audits of our backend infrastructure</li>
  <li>Access controls limiting employee access to user data</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

<h3>Consumable Purchases</h3>
<p>These items can be purchased multiple times:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stat Respec</strong> ($0.99) – Allows the player to reallocate all character stat points</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Consumable Purchases</h3>
<p>These are one-time purchases that persist permanently:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Remove Ads</strong> ($1.99) – Permanently removes all advertisements from the Application</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment Processing and Security</h3>
<p>All payment processing is handled securely through the Apple App Store. We do not directly collect or store your credit card information.</p>
<p>Purchase receipts are validated with Apple's servers to ensure transaction authenticity. We maintain a record of completed transactions (transaction ID, product purchased, date) to prevent fraud and provide customer support, but this record does not include your payment information.</p>
<p>Please refer to Apple's Privacy Policy for information on how they handle payment information.</p>

<h2>Firebase and Google Cloud Services</h2>
<p>The Application uses Google Firebase for authentication and data storage, as well as Google Cloud Run for backend game logic. These services process and store your game data according to Google's privacy policies and security standards.</p>
<p>Data stored with Firebase and Google Cloud:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Account credentials (encrypted)</li>
  <li>Game state (character stats, level, experience, gold, power score)</li>
  <li>Equipment and inventory data</li>
  <li>Player statistics and progression</li>
  <li>Battle history and combat logs</li>
  <li>Daily reward and login streak data</li>

<h2>Game Center Integration</h2>
<p>The Application integrates with Apple's Game Center for features such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Achievement tracking (battle victories, level milestones, loot collection)</li>
  <li>Leaderboards (player level, power score, PvP rating)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you connect to Game Center, your Game Center information is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy. We only receive your Game Center player ID and public information you choose to share (such as your Game Center nickname). We do not have access to your personal Apple ID or contact information.</p>
<p>You can disconnect Game Center at any time through your iOS device settings without affecting your ability to play Echoes of the Goetia.</p>

<h2>Multiplayer Interactions</h2>
<p>Echoes of the Goetia features PvP (player versus player) combat where your actions are visible to other players, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your display name (visible to opponents)</li>
  <li>Your character level and power score (visible during matchmaking and battle)</li>
  <li>Your combat actions and battle results (visible to your opponent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your display name is the only personally-identifiable information visible to other players. Other players cannot see your email address or any other personal data. The Application does not include direct messaging or chat features between players.</p>

<h2>Server-Authoritative Architecture</h2>
<p>For security and fair play, Echoes of the Goetia uses a server-authoritative architecture. This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All game actions are validated by our backend servers</li>
  <li>Your device has read-only access to game data</li>
  <li>All changes to game state (stat allocations, equipment changes, battle actions, loot generation) are processed through our secure Cloud Run API</li>
  <li>This prevents cheating and ensures fair gameplay for all users</li>
</ul>
<p>While this architecture requires an internet connection to play, it ensures the integrity of the multiplayer experience. Limited offline access to cached character and inventory data is available for viewing purposes only.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the updated policy on this page.</p>
<p>You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. The "Effective Date" at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States.</p>
<p>If you reside outside the United States, your information will be transferred, processed and stored there under United States privacy standards. By using the Application, you consent to this transfer and processing.</p>

<h2>Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Echoes of the Goetia uses cloud services hosted in the United States. If you access the Application from outside the United States, please be aware that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers and databases are located.</p>
