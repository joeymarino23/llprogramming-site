# Privacy Policy for Bukharo

**Last Updated: January 12, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the Bukharo card game app ("we", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

**Game Center Profile**
When you use multiplayer features, we access your Game Center display name (alias) to identify you to other players. This information is provided through Apple's Game Center service.

### Automatically Collected Information

**Game Preferences**
We store your game preferences locally on your device, including:
- Number of players setting
- Display preferences (game stats, card highlighting options)
- Saved game state (to resume interrupted games)

This data is stored only on your device using iOS's standard storage mechanisms and is not transmitted to our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Enable multiplayer gameplay through Apple Game Center
- Save your game progress and preferences
- Display your name to other players during multiplayer matches
- Send push notifications about game updates and your turn in multiplayer games

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Game Center
The App integrates with Apple Game Center for multiplayer functionality. When you authenticate with Game Center, Apple's privacy practices apply to the data they collect. For more information, see [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

### Google AdMob
The App may display advertisements through Google AdMob. Google may collect and use data for personalized advertising purposes. You can learn more about Google's data practices at [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings.

### Push Notifications
We use Apple Push Notification Services to notify you about multiplayer game turns and updates. You can disable push notifications at any time in your device's Settings app.

## Data Storage and Security

All game data and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not maintain servers that store your personal information. Multiplayer game data is transmitted directly between players through Apple's Game Center infrastructure.

## External Links

The App may contain links to external websites, including:
- PlayBukharo.com (our website)
- Amazon.com (for the Bukharo game guide)

These external sites have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The multiplayer features rely on Game Center, which has its own age restrictions and parental controls managed through Apple.

## Your Choices

**Game Center**: You can sign out of Game Center in your device's Settings to disable multiplayer features and prevent sharing of your Game Center profile.

**Notifications**: You can disable push notifications in your device's Settings app.

**Advertising**: You can limit ad tracking in your device's Privacy settings.

**Local Data**: You can delete all locally stored game data by uninstalling the App from your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date.
