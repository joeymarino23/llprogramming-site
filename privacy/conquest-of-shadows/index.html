<h2>Automatic Data Collection and Analytics</h2>
<p>We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage, which features are most popular, and how players progress through the game. This helps us improve the Application and provide a better gaming experience.</p>

<p>You can disconnect Game Center at any time through your iOS device settings without affecting your ability to play Conquest of Shadows.</p>
